# LifeisMomentum

Momentum is an analog of the Chrome online store application with the same name. The app shows the time and the username. The background image and greeting change depending on the time of day.
The application has a clock, an image slider, weather widgets, an audio player, a quote of the day block, settings. Local storage is used to store the user name and the locality.

Momentum is stylized according to the canon of the game Life is Strange. The project does not carry the function to replace Momentum, but serves as a test project for familiarization with such elements as: date and time, slider, audio player, API, local storage, asynchronous requests.
